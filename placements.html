  <h2>3.Network programmer</h2>
  <p2>Network programmers make it possible for gamers to play with each other. They develop the code behind online multiplayer games so that everything that happens in a game gets transmitted from one machine to another. This means the same things are displayed on each machine at more or less the same time which makes playing a game with people on other consoles and devices possible.

It’s one of the most complex areas of game planning as network programmers not only need to have an excellent understanding of game programming but also of network protocols and client/server engineering.</p2>

  <h2>5.Database manager</h2>
  <p4>Database managers are used to manage local and remote databases. They discover databases based on the Web server and provide the ability to connect to any of the databases residing in the network. They provide a handful of administrative functionalities such as managing tables, views and stored procedures, as well as run ad hoc queries.

DB managers connect to the database and display information from catalogs that are part of a database. DB managers can have a set of command-line parameters, which allow them to initiate features and functions external to the graphical user interface. 

DB managers allow database administrators to define new patches for databases or to easily apply new patches that come from vendors, thus updating databases with enhancements and keeping them secure.</p4>
